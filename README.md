# sociallyAnAPI REST API



A comprehensive collection of REST APIs for building a social media platform using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. These APIs cover a wide range of features from fundamental CRUD operations to advanced functionalities like authentication, image and story uploads, comments, likes, messaging, and more.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for various entities such as users, posts, comments, etc.
- **JWT Token Authentication:** Secure your APIs with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
- **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload images for their posts or profile pictures.
- **Comments and Replies:** Enable users to comment on posts and reply to comments.
- **Story Uploads:** Implement story functionality where users can upload short-lived posts.
- **Post Likes:** Allow users to like posts and track the number of likes.
- **Messaging Functionality:** Enable users to send and receive messages privately.
- **User Authentication:** Provide endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **JWT:** JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
